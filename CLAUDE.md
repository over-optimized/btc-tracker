The Bitcoin DCA Tracker is a modern React + TypeScript web application designed to help users track their Bitcoin Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) purchases across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. The app provides comprehensive analytics, visualizations, and transaction management capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (via CDN)
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time APIs
- **Vercel** - Frontend deployment and hosting
- **PNPM** as package manager

## Quick Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd btc-tracker
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # Start development server (http://localhost:5173)
```

## Project-Specific Commands

```bash
# Testing
pnpm test:e2e               # End-to-end testing with Playwright
pnpm test:e2e:ui            # Interactive test runner

# Analysis
pnpm build:analyze          # Bundle analysis with visualization
```

## Data Models

### Core Transaction Interface

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for deduplication
  date: Date; // Transaction timestamp
  exchange: string; // Exchange name
  type: string; // Transaction type (Purchase, Withdrawal, Sale, etc.)
  usdAmount: number; // USD amount (0 for withdrawals)
  btcAmount: number; // Bitcoin amount (positive for acquisitions)
  price: number; // Bitcoin price at transaction time

  // Extended fields for enhanced classification
  destinationWallet?: string; // Wallet name or address
  networkFee?: number; // Network fee in BTC
  isSelfCustody?: boolean; // Self-custody movement flag
  isTaxable?: boolean; // Taxable event flag
  counterparty?: string; // P2P transaction counterparty
  goodsServices?: string; // Description for taxable transactions
  sourceExchange?: string; // Source exchange for transfers
  destinationExchange?: string; // Destination exchange for transfers
}
```

## Project-Specific Standards

### Coverage Thresholds (Enforced)

- Overall: 75% minimum
- `src/hooks/`: 85% minimum
- `src/utils/tax*`: 95% minimum

### Feature Flag System

- **Development**: `VITE_ENABLE_EXPANDED_CLASSIFICATIONS=true`
- **Production**: Feature flags control legal compliance and risk management
- **Safe Mode**: High-risk features disabled in production

### Exchange Parser Details

#### Strike Parser

- **Trigger**: `Date & Time (UTC)` and `Transaction Type` fields
- **ID Generation**: Uses `Reference` field for stable IDs
- **Lightning Support**: Proper invoice handling and truncation

#### Coinbase Parser

- **Trigger**: `Transaction Type` field with "Buy" or "Purchase"
- **Multi-Format**: Supports various export format variations

#### Kraken Parser

- **Trigger**: `type: "trade"` with Bitcoin/USD pairs
- **Pair Filtering**: Only processes XBT/USD related trades

## Classification System

### 12 Classification Types

**Income (Non-Taxable)**

- Buy Bitcoin, Lightning Receive, P2P Receive, Mining Reward, Staking Reward, Airdrop

**Disposal (Taxable)**

- Sale, Lightning Send, P2P Send, Donation, Gift

**Transfer (Non-Taxable)**

- Transfer

## Current Development Status

### âœ… Recently Completed

1. **Enhanced Classification System** - 12-option dynamic classification with feature flags
2. **Lightning Transaction Support** - Complete Lightning Network transaction handling
3. **UX Improvements** - Contrast fixes, invoice truncation, Strike Reference display
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - 301 tests with robust coverage enforcement

### ðŸŽ¯ Active Development

- Smart recommendation engine with pattern detection
- Bulk classification intelligence and UX improvements

## Security & Compliance

- **Client-side Only**: No server-side data transmission (current architecture)
- **Local Storage**: All data stays in browser localStorage
- **Feature Flags**: Legal compliance through controlled feature rollout
- **Future**: Row Level Security with Supabase for multi-user production

## Performance Characteristics

- **Bundle Size**: Main bundle ~262KB, charts lazy-loaded ~347KB
- **Chart Rendering**: Recharts provides efficient canvas-based rendering
- **Data Processing**: In-memory processing suitable for thousands of transactions
