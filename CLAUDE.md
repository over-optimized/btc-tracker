## Data Models

### Core Transaction Interface

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for deduplication
  date: Date; // Transaction timestamp
  exchange: string; // Exchange name
  type: string; // Transaction type (Purchase, Withdrawal, Sale, etc.)
  usdAmount: number; // USD amount (0 for withdrawals)
  btcAmount: number; // Bitcoin amount (positive for acquisitions)
  price: number; // Bitcoin price at transaction time

  // Extended fields for withdrawal tracking
  destinationWallet?: string; // Wallet name or address where Bitcoin was sent
  networkFee?: number; // Network fee in BTC for withdrawals
  isSelfCustody?: boolean; // Flag indicating this is a self-custody movement
  isTaxable?: boolean; // Whether this creates a taxable event
}
```

### Portfolio Statistics

```typescript
interface Stats {
  totalInvested: number; // Total USD invested
  totalBitcoin: number; // Total BTC acquired
  avgCostBasis: number; // Average cost per BTC
  currentValue: number; // Current portfolio value
  unrealizedPnL: number; // Profit/Loss vs investment
}
```

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled - no implicit any
- **ESLint**: 0 critical errors (warnings acceptable)
- **Testing**: 75% overall coverage, 85% for hooks, 95% for tax calculations
- **Performance**: Main bundle <300KB, lazy loading for heavy components

### Git Workflow

- **Feature Branches**: Always create feature branches for new work
- **Quality Gates**: All tests and linting must pass before push
- **Conventional Commits**: Use standard commit message format
- **No Bypass**: Never use `--no-verify` to bypass quality checks

### Legal Compliance

- **Feature Flags**: All tax education features behind feature flags
- **Safe Mode**: Production runs with high-risk features disabled
- **Disclaimers**: Professional consultation guidance required

## Testing Strategy

### Coverage Thresholds (Enforced)

- Overall: 75% minimum
- `src/hooks/`: 85% minimum
- `src/utils/tax*`: 95% minimum

### Test Commands

```bash
# Specific test groups
pnpm test src/hooks/                    # All custom hook tests
pnpm test src/utils/__tests__/tax       # All tax calculation tests

# Coverage with different output formats
pnpm test:coverage              # CLI summary + HTML report
pnpm test:coverage:html         # Generate and open HTML report

# End-to-End Testing
pnpm test:e2e                   # All Playwright tests
pnpm test:e2e:ui                # Interactive test runner
```

## Exchange Parser Details

- **API Calls**: Only to public CoinGecko API (read-only)
- **Future**: Row Level Security with Supabase for multi-user production

## Performance Characteristics

- **Bundle Size**: Main bundle ~262KB, charts lazy-loaded ~347KB
- **Chart Rendering**: Recharts provides efficient canvas-based rendering
- **Data Processing**: In-memory processing suitable for thousands of transactions
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES2021+ features
