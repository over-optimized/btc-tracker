- **Vercel** - Frontend deployment and hosting
- **PNPM** as package manager

## Quick Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd btc-tracker
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # Start development server (http://localhost:5173)
```

## Project-Specific Commands

```bash
# Testing
pnpm test:e2e               # End-to-end testing with Playwright
pnpm test:e2e:ui            # Interactive test runner

# Analysis
pnpm build:analyze          # Bundle analysis with visualization
```

## Data Models

### Core Transaction Interface

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for deduplication
  date: Date; // Transaction timestamp
  exchange: string; // Exchange name
  type: string; // Transaction type (Purchase, Withdrawal, Sale, etc.)
  usdAmount: number; // USD amount (0 for withdrawals)
  btcAmount: number; // Bitcoin amount (positive for acquisitions)
  price: number; // Bitcoin price at transaction time

  // Extended fields for enhanced classification
  destinationWallet?: string; // Wallet name or address
  networkFee?: number; // Network fee in BTC
  isSelfCustody?: boolean; // Self-custody movement flag
  isTaxable?: boolean; // Taxable event flag
  counterparty?: string; // P2P transaction counterparty
  goodsServices?: string; // Description for taxable transactions
  sourceExchange?: string; // Source exchange for transfers
  destinationExchange?: string; // Destination exchange for transfers
}
```

## Project-Specific Standards

### Coverage Thresholds (Enforced)

- Overall: 75% minimum
- `src/hooks/`: 85% minimum
- `src/utils/tax*`: 95% minimum

### Feature Flag System

- **Development**: `VITE_ENABLE_EXPANDED_CLASSIFICATIONS=true`
- **Production**: Feature flags control legal compliance and risk management
- **Safe Mode**: High-risk features disabled in production

### Exchange Parser Details

#### Strike Parser

- **Trigger**: `Date & Time (UTC)` and `Transaction Type` fields
- **ID Generation**: Uses `Reference` field for stable IDs
- **Lightning Support**: Proper invoice handling and truncation

#### Coinbase Parser

- **Trigger**: `Transaction Type` field with "Buy" or "Purchase"
- **Multi-Format**: Supports various export format variations

#### Kraken Parser

- **Trigger**: `type: "trade"` with Bitcoin/USD pairs
- **Pair Filtering**: Only processes XBT/USD related trades

## Classification System

### 12 Classification Types

**Income (Non-Taxable)**

- Buy Bitcoin, Lightning Receive, P2P Receive, Mining Reward, Staking Reward, Airdrop

**Disposal (Taxable)**

- Sale, Lightning Send, P2P Send, Donation, Gift

**Transfer (Non-Taxable)**

- Transfer

## Current Development Status

This project follows the global CLAUDE.md development standards for workflow, testing, and quality gates.

## Git Workflow Standards

### Branch Management

**Required Workflow:**

1. **Feature Branches**: Always create feature branches from `staging` for new work
2. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names like `feat/phase-1c-optional-authentication`
3. **Never Direct Commits**: Avoid committing directly to `staging` - use feature branches
4. **Pull Requests**: Create PRs from feature branch to `staging` for code review

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# Create feature branch from staging
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# Work on feature, commit frequently
git add -A && git commit -m "descriptive message"

# Push feature branch and create PR
git push -u origin feat/your-feature-name
gh pr create --title "feat: Your Feature" --body "Description..."

# After PR approval, merge to staging
```

**Branch Recovery (if commits made directly to staging):**

```bash
# Create feature branch from current HEAD
git checkout -b feat/feature-name

# Reset staging to match origin
git checkout staging
git reset --hard origin/staging

# Push feature branch and create PR
git checkout feat/feature-name
git push -u origin feat/feature-name
```

- Do not use the Generated with Claude Code signature on PRs
- non negotiable, never use --no-verify for git commands
