## Legal Compliance Framework

### Core Principles

1. **No Prescriptive Tax Advice**: Never provide definitive tax guidance or instructions
2. **Mathematical Calculations Only**: Present computational results without interpretation
3. **Professional Consultation Requirements**: Direct users to qualified professionals for all tax matters
4. **Feature Flag Protection**: Use environment-based controls to manage legal risk
5. **Proactive Risk Management**: Monitor and respond to legal developments

### Compliance Hierarchy

```
Level 1: Safe Mode (Production Default)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Portfolio tracking and mathematical calculations only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Basic disclaimers and professional consultation guidance
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No prescriptive tax advice or educational content

Level 2: Enhanced Mode (Staging/Review)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mathematical calculations with enhanced disclaimers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generic transaction classification guidance
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Professional consultation requirements throughout

Level 3: Full Mode (Development Only)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ All educational features active for development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Comprehensive tax guidance (for legal review only)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Full feature testing and development capabilities
```

## Pre-Development Legal Review Process

### 1. Feature Proposal Assessment

#### New Feature Risk Assessment Checklist

**For ANY new tax-related feature, complete this assessment:**

- [ ] **Risk Category Determination**
  - [ ] High Risk: Provides prescriptive tax advice or definitive guidance
  - [ ] Medium Risk: Tax calculations or interpretive content requiring disclaimers
  - [ ] Low Risk: Mathematical calculations or data processing only

- [ ] **Content Review Requirements**
  - [ ] Does the feature provide specific tax guidance? (If YES ‚Üí High Risk)
  - [ ] Does the feature interpret tax calculations? (If YES ‚Üí Medium Risk)
  - [ ] Does the feature reference IRS regulations? (If YES ‚Üí Legal Review Required)
  - [ ] Could users interpret this as professional tax advice? (If YES ‚Üí High Risk)

- [ ] **Legal Safeguards Assessment**
  - [ ] Feature flag implementation planned
  - [ ] Appropriate disclaimers identified
  - [ ] Professional consultation pathways included
  - [ ] Safe mode fallback designed

#### Risk Assessment Decision Matrix

| Assessment Result | Action Required |
|------------------|----------------|
| **High Risk Feature** | Legal review REQUIRED before development |
| **Medium Risk Feature** | Enhanced disclaimers required, legal review recommended |
| **Low Risk Feature** | Standard disclaimers sufficient, proceed with development |

### 2. Legal Review Request Process

#### When Legal Review is Required

- All High Risk features (prescriptive tax advice)
- New tax calculation methodologies
- IRS regulation references or interpretations
- Educational content with tax guidance
- Any content that could be interpreted as professional advice

#### Legal Review Request Template

```

## Development Phase Compliance

### 1. Safe Mode Development Standard

#### Primary Development Approach
**ALWAYS develop safe mode functionality FIRST:**

```
Development Order:
1. Safe Mode UI/UX (mathematical calculations only)
2. Appropriate disclaimers and professional guidance
3. Enhanced features behind feature flags
4. Educational/advisory content (development only)
```

#### Safe Mode Requirements

**Required Elements in ALL Safe Mode Features:**
- Mathematical calculations without interpretation
- "Informational purposes only" disclaimers
- Professional consultation guidance ("Consult a qualified CPA")
- Links to authoritative sources (IRS.gov)
- Clear tool limitation statements

### 2. Feature Flag Implementation Requirements

#### Mandatory Feature Flag Categories

```typescript
// High Risk Features - NEVER in production without legal approval
EDUCATIONAL_COMPONENTS: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
TAX_EDUCATION_HUB: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'  
DETAILED_TAX_GUIDANCE: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'

// Medium Risk Features - Enhanced disclaimers required
ADVANCED_TAX_TOOLTIPS: process.env.VITE_LEGAL_REVIEW_COMPLETE === 'true'
TAX_OPTIMIZATION_SUGGESTIONS: process.env.VITE_LEGAL_APPROVAL === 'true'

// Safe Mode Features - Always enabled with disclaimers
PORTFOLIO_TRACKING: true
MATHEMATICAL_CALCULATIONS: true
```

### 3. Content Standards Enforcement

#### Prohibited Language Patterns

**NEVER use these phrases in production features:**
- "This is taxable income"
- "You must report..."
- "Creates tax liability of $X"
- "Follow IRS guidelines"
- "Tax-free transaction"
- "Deductible expense"
- Any definitive tax statements

#### Approved Safe Language Patterns

**Use these alternative formulations:**
- "Generally considered [type] for tax purposes - consult CPA"
- "May require reporting - professional guidance recommended"
- "Mathematical calculation only - not tax preparation"
- "See IRS.gov for authoritative guidance"
- "Professional tax advice required"
