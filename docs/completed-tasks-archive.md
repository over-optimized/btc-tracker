## Historical Context & Project Evolution

### Before Q1 2025

The project started as a simple Bitcoin DCA transaction tracker with basic CSV import capabilities. Initial versions focused on:

- Basic transaction import from Strike
- Simple portfolio value calculations
- localStorage data persistence
- Manual CSV processing

### Q1 2025 Transformation

The Q1 2025 development cycle transformed the application into a comprehensive Bitcoin portfolio management platform:

- **From Simple Tracking ‚Üí Professional Tax Reporting**
- **From Single Exchange ‚Üí Multi-Exchange Support**
- **From Basic Import ‚Üí Intelligent Classification**
- **From Portfolio Tracking ‚Üí Security Risk Assessment**
- **From Manual Process ‚Üí Automated Analysis**

### Foundation for Production

All Q1 2025 features were designed with production scalability in mind:

- Modular architecture supporting multi-user deployment
- Comprehensive error handling for production reliability
- Professional-grade export formats for real-world usage
- Security-first design principles throughout

This foundation enables the Q2 2025 infrastructure phase to focus purely on deployment and scaling rather than feature development.
