## Historical Context & Project Evolution

### Before Q1 2025
The project started as a simple Bitcoin DCA transaction tracker with basic CSV import capabilities. Initial versions focused on:
- Basic transaction import from Strike
- Simple portfolio value calculations
- localStorage data persistence
- Manual CSV processing

### Q1 2025 Transformation
The Q1 2025 development cycle transformed the application into a comprehensive Bitcoin portfolio management platform:
- **From Simple Tracking → Professional Tax Reporting**
- **From Single Exchange → Multi-Exchange Support**
- **From Basic Import → Intelligent Classification**
- **From Portfolio Tracking → Security Risk Assessment**
- **From Manual Process → Automated Analysis**

### Foundation for Production
All Q1 2025 features were designed with production scalability in mind:
- Modular architecture supporting multi-user deployment
- Comprehensive error handling for production reliability
- Professional-grade export formats for real-world usage
- Security-first design principles throughout

This foundation enables the Q2 2025 infrastructure phase to focus purely on deployment and scaling rather than feature development.
