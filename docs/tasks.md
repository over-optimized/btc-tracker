# Development Tasks

This file tracks **active and upcoming** development tasks. **Phase shift**: Moving from localhost-complete application to multi-user production deployment with foundation-first approach.

## 📋 Task Management Guidelines

### Planning & Organization

- **Task Structure**: Each task includes status, priority, estimate, dependencies, and completion notes
- **Status Values**: `todo` | `in-progress` | `completed` | `blocked`
- **Priority Levels**: `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low`
- **Estimates**: Story points (1-13 scale) or time estimates
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites that must be completed first

### Maintenance Rules

- **Keep Current**: Focus on active phases and next 1-2 upcoming phases
- **Archive Completed**: Move completed phases (>3 months old) to [completed-tasks-archive.md](completed-tasks-archive.md)
- **Update Regularly**: Mark tasks complete immediately, update status in real-time
- **Track Progress**: Use point totals and completion percentages for phase tracking

### Task Creation Process

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Break down features into actionable tasks (3-8 points each)
2. **Set Dependencies**: Identify prerequisites and logical order
3. **Estimate Effort**: Use consistent point scale across similar work
4. **Define Success**: Clear completion criteria and impact statements
5. **Track Continuously**: Update status, add notes, archive when complete

### Phase Management

- **Definition of Done**: All tasks completed, tested, documented, and deployed
- **Archival Trigger**: Phase completed >3 months ago OR file exceeds 300 lines
- **Archive Format**: Move to archive with context, completion dates, and impact summary
- **Focus Maintenance**: Keep main file under 200 lines for readability

## ⚡ Infrastructure Approach Rationale

### Why Foundation-First Development?

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Validate infrastructure before advanced features
2. **Cost Control**: Start free, scale gradually based on real usage
3. **User Safety**: Proper authentication before API key storage
4. **Technical Debt**: Avoid premature optimization without real data
5. **Market Validation**: Test demand before heavy API development investment

### Quality Standards (Maintained Throughout)

- **Test Coverage**: >90% for critical calculations, >80% overall
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive recovery options
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times
- **Security**: Industry-standard authentication and data protection
