# Development Tasks

This file tracks **active and upcoming** development tasks. **Phase shift**: Moving from localhost-complete application to multi-user production deployment with foundation-first approach.

## üìã Task Management Guidelines

### Planning & Organization

- **Task Structure**: Each task includes status, priority, estimate, dependencies, and completion notes
- **Status Values**: `todo` | `in-progress` | `completed` | `blocked`
- **Priority Levels**: `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low`
- **Estimates**: Story points (1-13 scale) or time estimates
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites that must be completed first

### Maintenance Rules

- **Keep Current**: Focus on active phases and next 1-2 upcoming phases
- **Archive Completed**: Move completed phases (>3 months old) to [completed-tasks-archive.md](completed-tasks-archive.md)
- **Update Regularly**: Mark tasks complete immediately, update status in real-time
- **Track Progress**: Use point totals and completion percentages for phase tracking

### Task Creation Process

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Break down features into actionable tasks (3-8 points each)
2. **Set Dependencies**: Identify prerequisites and logical order
3. **Estimate Effort**: Use consistent point scale across similar work
4. **Define Success**: Clear completion criteria and impact statements
5. **Track Continuously**: Update status, add notes, archive when complete

### Phase Management

- **Definition of Done**: All tasks completed, tested, documented, and deployed
- **Archival Trigger**: Phase completed >3 months ago OR file exceeds 300 lines
- **Archive Format**: Move to archive with context, completion dates, and impact summary
- **Focus Maintenance**: Keep main file under 200 lines for readability

### üöÄ Infrastructure Ready For

- **Multi-user deployment** with optional Supabase authentication
- **Anonymous-first operation** with localStorage-only mode
- **Cloud backup enhancement** for users who opt-in to authentication
- **Seamless data migration** between localStorage and Supabase (tested & validated)
- **Production scaling** with comprehensive test coverage and performance monitoring
- **Confident development** with 78+ automated test scenarios preventing regressions
- **Performance optimization** with event-driven architecture (90% API call reduction ready)
- **API integrations** with exchange automation
- **Advanced features** development

### üîë Phase 1C Key Achievements

**üéØ Core Principle Maintained**: Authentication is completely optional - app works fully without any signup requirement

**üì± User Experience**:

- **Anonymous users**: Full functionality, zero friction, privacy-first experience unchanged
- **Authenticated users**: Additional cloud backup, multi-device sync, data persistence benefits
- **Migration**: User-initiated with clear benefits explanation and rollback capability

**üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture**:

- **AuthContext**: Optional authentication with graceful unauthenticated handling
- **AutoStorageProvider**: Intelligent switching between localStorage and Supabase
- **Dual-mode UI**: Authentication positioned as "data backup" enhancement, not requirement
- **Loading states**: Proper initialization handling with fallback to localStorage
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when Supabase unavailable
- **Auth-aware data loading**: Eliminates premature database calls, coordinated loading states

### üîß Phase 1C‚Üí1D Bridge: Data Migration Gap

**Discovered Issue**: Users transitioning from anonymous to authenticated see empty state despite having localStorage transaction data.

**Phase 1D Enhancement**: Expanded "User experience improvements" task to include automatic localStorage‚ÜíSupabase migration with:

- **Auto-detection**: Identify localStorage data on successful authentication
- **Seamless migration**: Background transfer using existing `AutoStorageProvider.migrateToAuthenticated()`
- **Progress feedback**: User-friendly migration status and success confirmation
- **Error handling**: Graceful migration failure recovery with retry options

This completes the Phase 1C infrastructure with proper user experience continuity.

**Phase 2 Total**: 26 points | **Target**: 3-4 weeks | **Cost**: ~$10-25/month

### üîê Phase 2 Key Enhancement: Authentication Status Optimization

**Context-Aware Authentication Status System**:

**Problem Solved**: Current header shows generic authentication states without considering user history or space constraints. Email addresses consume valuable header real estate, and messaging doesn't adapt to user scenarios.

**Solution Components**:

1. **Authentication History Tracking**
   - Track user authentication patterns in localStorage
   - Distinguish between "never authenticated", "previously authenticated", and "intentionally anonymous" users
   - Support multi-user device scenarios

2. **Space-Efficient Header Design**
   - **Authenticated**: `"Synced to cloud"` (email in hover tooltip only)
   - **Never Authenticated + Has Data**: `"Backup & Sync"` with data count context
   - **Previously Authenticated**: `"Sign in"` with personalized messaging
   - **Intentionally Anonymous**: `"Local only"` respecting user choice

3. **Mobile-First Optimization**
   - Progressive disclosure: essential info first, details on interaction
   - Consistent iconography with status indicators
   - Dropdown/modal for secondary options

4. **Enhanced DataFreshnessCard Integration**
   - Context-aware messaging based on authentication history
   - Personalized prompts that respect user preferences
   - Smart recommendations for data backup timing

**User Experience Benefits**: Reduces header clutter, provides contextual authentication guidance, and respects user privacy preferences while maximizing mobile and desktop space efficiency.

## ‚ö° Infrastructure Approach Rationale

### Why Foundation-First Development?

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Validate infrastructure before advanced features
2. **Cost Control**: Start free, scale gradually based on real usage
3. **User Safety**: Proper authentication before API key storage
4. **Technical Debt**: Avoid premature optimization without real data
5. **Market Validation**: Test demand before heavy API development investment

### Quality Standards (Maintained Throughout)

- **Test Coverage**: >90% for critical calculations, >80% overall
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive recovery options
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times
- **Security**: Industry-standard authentication and data protection
