## üí∞ Cost-Effective Technology Choices

### Alpha Phase (~$0/month)
- **Vercel**: Free tier (hobby projects)
- **Supabase**: Free tier (500MB DB, 50,000 requests)
- **GitHub**: Free (public repo + 2000 Action minutes)
- **Domain**: Free subdomain (btc-tracker.vercel.app)

### Beta Phase (~$10-25/month)
- **Vercel**: Free tier likely sufficient
- **Supabase**: May need Pro plan ($25/month) for more DB storage
- **Custom Domain**: ~$10-15/year
- **Monitoring**: Sentry free tier

### Production Phase (Revenue-dependent)
- Scale pricing based on actual usage
- Monitor cost vs user growth ratio
- Optimize before upgrading tiers

## ‚ö° Infrastructure Approach Rationale

### Why Foundation-First Development?
1. **Risk Mitigation**: Validate infrastructure before advanced features
2. **Cost Control**: Start free, scale gradually based on real usage  
3. **User Safety**: Proper authentication before API key storage
4. **Technical Debt**: Avoid premature optimization without real data
5. **Market Validation**: Test demand before heavy API development investment

### Quality Standards (Maintained Throughout)
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for critical calculations, >80% overall
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode  
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive recovery options
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times
- **Security**: Industry-standard authentication and data protection
