## ⚡ Infrastructure Approach Rationale

### Why Foundation-First Development?

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Validate infrastructure before advanced features
2. **Cost Control**: Start free, scale gradually based on real usage
3. **User Safety**: Proper authentication before API key storage
4. **Technical Debt**: Avoid premature optimization without real data
5. **Market Validation**: Test demand before heavy API development investment

### Quality Standards (Maintained Throughout)

- **Test Coverage**: >90% for critical calculations, >80% overall
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive recovery options
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times
- **Security**: Industry-standard authentication and data protection
