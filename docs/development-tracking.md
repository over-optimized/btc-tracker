# Development Tracking & Cost Analysis

## Token Usage Tracking

For budget tracking and development cost analysis, track Claude token usage after completing each task or feature.

### After completing each significant task/feature, ask Claude:

```
Please provide a token usage summary for this task, including:
- Input tokens used
- Output tokens generated
- Total tokens for this task
- Brief description of what was accomplished
```

### Manual Tracking Format

```
Task: [Task/Feature Name]
Date: [Date Completed]
Accomplished: [Brief description]
Input Tokens: [Number]
Output Tokens: [Number]
Total Cost Estimate: [Based on Sonnet 4 pricing: $3 input + $15 output per 1M tokens]
```

### Benefits of Task-Based Tracking

- ✅ Captures data before session ends
- ✅ Links costs directly to deliverables
- ✅ Better granularity for budgeting
- ✅ No risk of losing token data on session exit

> **Future Enhancement**: Advanced automated cost analysis CLI tools planned - see docs/tasks.md

## Documentation Workflow & Maintenance

```bash
# Track new tasks and estimates
vim docs/tasks.md

# Document completed features
vim CHANGELOG.md

# Update this file for architectural changes
vim CLAUDE.md
```

## Development Metrics for CHANGELOG

When adding entries to CHANGELOG.md, include development statistics:

```markdown
**Development Stats:**

- Model: Claude Sonnet 4
- Tokens: [X] input / [Y] output
- Estimated Cost: $[Z]
- Story Points: [N]
```

This ensures the project documentation stays current and accurate for future development work.

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Efficient Development Practices

1. **Batch Related Tasks**: Group similar tasks to reduce context switching
2. **Clear Requirements**: Well-defined tasks reduce back-and-forth iterations
3. **Incremental Development**: Small, focused changes rather than large rewrites
4. **Reuse Patterns**: Leverage existing code patterns and components

### Token Usage Optimization

1. **Specific Requests**: Ask for exactly what you need
2. **Context Management**: Provide relevant context without excess
3. **Code Focus**: Request specific file modifications rather than full rewrites
4. **Testing Strategy**: Focus on critical path testing first

### Budget Planning

- Track costs per feature to improve future estimates
- Monitor token usage trends over development phases
- Plan major refactoring during dedicated budget periods
- Use cost data to prioritize feature development order
