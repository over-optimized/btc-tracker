## Current vs Enhanced Classification System

### Current Classifications (4 options)
```typescript
enum TransactionClassification {
  PURCHASE = 'purchase',                    // Buy/Purchase (taxable acquisition)
  SELF_CUSTODY_WITHDRAWAL = 'self_custody_withdrawal', // Withdrawal to own wallet (non-taxable)
  SALE = 'sale',                           // Sale for USD (taxable disposal)
  SKIP = 'skip',                          // Don't import this transaction
}
```

### Enhanced Classifications (12 options)

```typescript
enum TransactionClassification {
  // ACQUISITIONS (Taxable Income Events)
  PURCHASE = 'purchase',                   // Direct Bitcoin purchase (taxable acquisition)
  GIFT_RECEIVED = 'gift_received',         // Bitcoin received as gift (taxable income at FMV)
  PAYMENT_RECEIVED = 'payment_received',   // Bitcoin received for goods/services (taxable income)
  REIMBURSEMENT_RECEIVED = 'reimbursement_received', // Bitcoin received as expense reimbursement (taxable)
  MINING_INCOME = 'mining_income',         // Mining rewards (taxable income at FMV)
  STAKING_INCOME = 'staking_income',       // Staking/yield rewards (taxable income at FMV)
  
  // DISPOSALS (Taxable Capital Gain/Loss Events)
  SALE = 'sale',                          // Sale for USD (taxable disposal)
  GIFT_SENT = 'gift_sent',                // Bitcoin given as gift (taxable disposal at FMV)
  PAYMENT_SENT = 'payment_sent',          // Bitcoin spent for goods/services (taxable disposal)
  
  // NON-TAXABLE MOVEMENTS
  SELF_CUSTODY_WITHDRAWAL = 'self_custody_withdrawal', // Move to own wallet (non-taxable)
  EXCHANGE_TRANSFER = 'exchange_transfer', // Transfer between exchanges (non-taxable)
  
  // SYSTEM OPTIONS
  SKIP = 'skip',                          // Don't import this transaction
}
```

## Enhanced Classification Decision Interface

### Additional Data Fields Required

```typescript
interface EnhancedClassificationDecision {
  transactionId: string;
  classification: TransactionClassification;
  
  // Tax calculation fields
  usdValue?: number;            // Fair market value (for income events)
  costBasis?: number;           // Known cost basis (for disposals)
  
  // Context fields
  destinationWallet?: string;   // For self-custody
  sourceExchange?: string;      // For transfers
  counterparty?: string;        // Who you transacted with
  goodsServices?: string;       // What was purchased/provided
  
  // User notes
  notes?: string;
  
  // Tax implications
  taxEvent: TaxEventType;       // INCOME, DISPOSAL, NON_TAXABLE
  estimatedTaxImpact?: number;  // Calculated impact preview
}

enum TaxEventType {
  INCOME = 'income',           // Taxable income at FMV
  DISPOSAL = 'disposal',       // Capital gains/loss calculation
  NON_TAXABLE = 'non_taxable'  // No tax implications
}
```

### Visual Tax Indicators

```typescript
const TAX_INDICATORS = {
  [TaxEventType.INCOME]: {
    color: 'green',
    icon: '📈',
    label: 'Taxable Income',
    description: 'Report as income at fair market value'
  },
  [TaxEventType.DISPOSAL]: {
    color: 'red', 
    icon: '📉',
    label: 'Taxable Disposal',
    description: 'Calculate capital gains/losses'
  },
  [TaxEventType.NON_TAXABLE]: {
    color: 'blue',
    icon: '🔒',
    label: 'Non-Taxable',
    description: 'No immediate tax implications'
  }
};
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Enum Expansion
1. Update `TransactionClassification.ts` with new enum values
2. Add enhanced decision interface
3. Update existing components to handle new fields

### Phase 2: Educational Integration  
1. Add tax implication indicators to UI
2. Create classification guidance tooltips
3. Build scenario-based help system

### Phase 3: Smart Detection
1. Enhance transaction classifier with new patterns
2. Add confidence scoring for new types
3. Build bulk classification suggestions

### Phase 4: Tax Integration
1. Update tax calculator for all new event types
2. Add proper cost basis tracking
3. Integrate with existing FIFO/LIFO/HIFO methods

## Migration Strategy (Pre-Alpha)

### Backwards Compatibility
- **Not Required**: Pre-alpha status allows breaking changes
- **Data Reset Option**: Provide export-then-reset workflow
- **Migration Utility**: Convert existing classifications where possible

### Migration Mapping
```typescript
const MIGRATION_MAP = {
  'purchase' -> TransactionClassification.PURCHASE,
  'self_custody_withdrawal' -> TransactionClassification.SELF_CUSTODY_WITHDRAWAL,
  'sale' -> TransactionClassification.SALE,
  'skip' -> TransactionClassification.SKIP,
  // New types will require user re-classification
};
```
