# Legal Compliance & Risk Management Plan

## Executive Summary

**Critical Issue Identified**: The Bitcoin DCA Tracker app contains educational content that presents definitive tax advice, creating significant legal liability risks for both users and developers.

**Solution**: Implement a comprehensive feature toggle system to disable high-risk educational features in production while preserving all development work and providing a clear path to compliant feature rollout.

**Status**: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Legal risk mitigation in progress

- **Risk**: Contains statements like "This is taxable," "Must be reported," "Creates taxable income"
- **Legal Issue**: Could be interpreted as providing professional tax advice without proper disclaimers

#### Educational Components with Definitive Guidance
- **Location**: `src/components/educational/` directory
- **Risk**: Provides specific tax guidance without professional consultation requirements
- **Legal Issue**: Potential unauthorized practice of tax preparation or advice

#### IRS Regulation References
- **Location**: Multiple components referencing IRS rules
- **Risk**: Claims to "follow IRS regulations" without proper legal disclaimers
- **Legal Issue**: Could create liability if guidance becomes outdated or incorrect

#### Lightning Network Tax Scenarios
- **Location**: Educational content with specific Lightning transaction tax treatments
- **Risk**: Definitive statements about complex tax scenarios
- **Legal Issue**: Tax treatment of Lightning transactions is evolving area of law

### Medium Risk Areas

#### Tax Calculation Displays
- **Current**: Mathematical calculations presented without disclaimers
- **Risk**: Could be interpreted as tax preparation services
- **Mitigation**: Add "mathematical calculations only" disclaimers

#### Transaction Classification Guidance
- **Current**: Specific guidance on tax treatment of transaction types
- **Risk**: Could be seen as providing tax classification advice
- **Mitigation**: Add professional consultation requirements
