              body: `ðŸ‘‹ Hi! This PR is currently targeting the \`main\` branch.
              
              **For our development workflow, feature PRs should typically target \`staging\` instead.**
              
              **To change the base branch:**
              1. Click "Edit" next to the PR title above
              2. Change base branch from \`main\` to \`staging\` in the dropdown
              3. Click "Change base"
              
              **Why staging first?**
              - \`staging\` â†’ automated testing and preview deployment
              - \`staging\` â†’ \`main\` â†’ production deployment
              - This ensures all changes are tested before reaching production
              
              If this PR is intentionally targeting \`main\` (e.g., hotfix, documentation), you can safely ignore this message. ðŸš€`
