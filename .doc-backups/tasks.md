## 💰 Cost-Effective Technology Choices

### Alpha Phase (~$0/month)
- **Vercel**: Free tier (hobby projects)
- **Supabase**: Free tier (500MB DB, 50,000 requests)
- **GitHub**: Free (public repo + 2000 Action minutes)
- **Domain**: Free subdomain (btc-tracker.vercel.app)

### Beta Phase (~$10-25/month)
- **Vercel**: Free tier likely sufficient
- **Supabase**: May need Pro plan ($25/month) for more DB storage
- **Custom Domain**: ~$10-15/year
- **Monitoring**: Sentry free tier

### Production Phase (Revenue-dependent)
- Scale pricing based on actual usage
- Monitor cost vs user growth ratio
- Optimize before upgrading tiers
